# Dynamic vs Static Typing

All major programming languages that we work with are either **dynamically typed** or 
**statically typed**.

**Dynamically typed** means that the type of variables can change at runtime.

**Statically typed** means that the type of variables cannot change once declared.

Statically typed languages promote safety and help detect errors at an early stage.
